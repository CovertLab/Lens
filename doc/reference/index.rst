Reference Material
==================

This reference material is for users who need to look up a specific
piece of information. If you want to understand a topic more
comprehensively, try a :doc:`topic guide <../guides/index>` instead. If
you are new to Vivarium, check out our :doc:`getting started guide
<../getting_started>`.

The :doc:`API Reference <api/modules>` is a representation of the
docstrings from Vivarium's code. This is a great place to look up
details on how to use one of our classes or functions.

In our :doc:`glossary <glossary>` we explain how we use terms specific
to Vivarium.
