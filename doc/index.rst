============
Introduction
============

A vivarium, literally a "place of life," is a controlled environment in
which organisms can be studied. You might have encountered examples of
vivaria like an aquarium or a terarium. The Vivarium project provides a
framework for creating a computational vivarium which can simulate
colonies of whole-cell models in a shared, dynamic environment.
